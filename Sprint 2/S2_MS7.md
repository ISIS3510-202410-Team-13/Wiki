## Revenue Model

We could define the first fraction of our proposed revenue model as in-app advertising that follows a “freemium” methodology. What we mean by this is that we intend to have banner ads—not necessarily related to our operation—in some specific views. However, if any user wants to remove them completely, they can pay a one-time fee to access an ad-free version of the platform—hence the “freemium” part. We opt for banner ads specifically because they are not as invasive as others and don’t quite affect the app’s normal course of use.

The other revenue model we thought of implementing was that of data monetization. Since we collect data on students’ schedules and possible whereabouts with friends and colleagues, we could provide this information to entities s that believe could make good use of knowing when, where, and with what purpose could students be meeting in order to offer specific services or plan strategies to improve their own business or create a new one. By “taking advantage” of this need we could further monetize our idea.

# UI/UX Design

## Colour palette

![sadfasf](https://github.com/ISIS3510-202410-Team-13/Wiki/assets/78111224/e18fd28e-d6f7-406e-8900-dca47373b7de)

### Rationale for Color Palette

The color palette chosen for UniSchedule was carefully selected to evoke specific emotions and associations that align with the app's purpose and target audience. Here's the rationale behind each color:

- **#9FA5C0 (Blue):** This shade of blue symbolizes trust, professionalism, and reliability. It conveys a sense of dependability and credibility, which is crucial for a scheduling app aimed at university students who value efficient and reliable tools to manage their time effectively.
- **#F8F8F8 (White):** White represents cleanliness, simplicity, and clarity. It provides a clean and neutral background that enhances readability and visual contrast, ensuring that content and UI elements stand out clearly against the backdrop.
- **#9DCC18 (Green):** Green is associated with growth, balance, and harmony. In the context of UniSchedule, this shade of green reflects the app's mission to help users grow academically and personally by achieving a balanced schedule and harmonious time management.
- **#FFFFFF (White):** Another shade of white is used strategically to maintain consistency and cohesiveness throughout the app's design. It complements the primary colors and contributes to a minimalist and modern aesthetic.

By incorporating these colors into the app's design, UniSchedule aims to create a visually engaging and harmonious user experience that fosters positivity, productivity, and a sense of well-being.

[People | Circle flat](https://www.flaticon.es/packs/people-5?word=people)

### Rationale for Images and Illustrations

The inclusion of the Roundicons collection, particularly the 'People | Circle flat' pack, and the Retro Cartoon Student Sticker Pack, plays a pivotal role in enriching the visual appeal and user experience of UniSchedule. These image assets are carefully selected to imbue the application with a sense of vibrancy, playfulness, and relatability, resonating with the target audience of university students.

## Navigational Patterns

In the design, the following navigational patterns and UI elements are employed to enhance user experience:

- **Bottom Navigation Menu**: This is a navigation bar located at the bottom of the screen. It provides users with easy access to the app's main sections, such as the home page, calendar page, friend list and groups list. This pattern is especially useful for mobile apps, where the bottom part of the screen is easily reachable with the user's thumbs.

- **Hamburger Menu**: Represented by an icon consisting of three horizontal lines, the hamburger menu is used to hide the app's secondary navigation options. This menu is accessed from the top left corner of the app and expands to reveal additional options like settings, help, and other less frequently used functions.

- **Infinite Scroll**: This feature is applied to the friends and groups lists within the app. It allows users to continuously scroll through a list of items without the interruption of pagination. As the user scrolls down, more friends or groups are loaded and displayed automatically. This creates a seamless experience for users who are browsing through large lists.

- **Cards**: Each group and class in the app is presented in the form of a "card". These cards contain concise information representing the group or class, making it easier for users to browse and select from various options. The card-based design organizes information into digestible chunks and provides a clean, visually appealing layout for user interaction.

These navigational patterns and UI elements are designed to create an intuitive and efficient user experience, making it easy for users to navigate the app and find the information they need.

### Rationale for Navigation Patterns

The selection of specific navigational patterns and UI elements within UniSchedule is rooted in the pursuit of creating a seamless and intuitive user experience tailored to the needs and preferences of university students. The incorporation of a Bottom Navigation Menu serves as a focal point for user interaction, providing quick and convenient access to essential sections of the app such as the home page, calendar, friend list, and groups list. By positioning the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, UniSchedule maximizes accessibility, particularly on mobile devices, where users can effortlessly navigate through the app's core functionalities with minimal thumb movement.

Additionally, the inclusion of a Hamburger Menu complements the primary navigation system by offering a hidden repository for secondary navigation options and less frequently accessed features. Located at the top left corner of the app, the hamburger menu presents users with a familiar interface paradigm, allowing them to access settings, help resources, and other auxiliary functions without cluttering the main screen. This design choice optimizes screen real estate and promotes a clean and uncluttered interface, enhancing overall usability and reducing cognitive load for users.

The integration of Infinite Scroll functionality further enhances the user experience, particularly when browsing through extensive lists of friends or groups within the app. By eliminating the need for pagination and enabling continuous scrolling, UniSchedule ensures a seamless and uninterrupted browsing experience for users, enabling them to effortlessly explore and discover relevant content without cumbersome navigation controls. This intuitive design approach fosters engagement and encourages users to interact more freely with the app's social and collaborative features.

Moreover, the adoption of a Card-based design paradigm for presenting groups and classes within the app offers several benefits in terms of information organization and visual hierarchy. Each card encapsulates concise information about a specific group or class, facilitating quick comprehension and decision-making for users. The use of cards also introduces consistency and visual coherence throughout the app, contributing to a cohesive and harmonious user experience. By leveraging these navigational patterns and UI elements, UniSchedule endeavors to deliver an intuitive and efficient platform that empowers users to effortlessly navigate, connect, and collaborate within the university community.
