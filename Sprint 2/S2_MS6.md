## UI Prototype

## Navigational Patterns

In the design, the following navigational patterns and UI elements are employed to enhance user experience:

- **Bottom Navigation Menu**: This is a navigation bar located at the bottom of the screen. It provides users with easy access to the app's main sections, such as the home page, calendar page, friend list and groups list. This pattern is especially useful for mobile apps, where the bottom part of the screen is easily reachable with the user's thumbs.

- **Hamburger Menu**: Represented by an icon consisting of three horizontal lines, the hamburger menu is used to hide the app's secondary navigation options. This menu is accessed from the top left corner of the app and expands to reveal additional options like settings, help, and other less frequently used functions.

- **Infinite Scroll**: This feature is applied to the friends and groups lists within the app. It allows users to continuously scroll through a list of items without the interruption of pagination. As the user scrolls down, more friends or groups are loaded and displayed automatically. This creates a seamless experience for users who are browsing through large lists.

- **Cards**: Each group and class in the app is presented in the form of a "card". These cards contain concise information representing the group or class, making it easier for users to browse and select from various options. The card-based design organizes information into digestible chunks and provides a clean, visually appealing layout for user interaction.

These navigational patterns and UI elements are designed to create an intuitive and efficient user experience, making it easy for users to navigate the app and find the information they need.
