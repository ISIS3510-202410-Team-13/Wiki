# Problems-Alternative-Solutions (PAS)

## PAS 1

_Author: Juan Sebastian Urrea Lopez_

**Problem:**
Many university students struggle with organizing their extracurricular activities and commitments alongside their academic schedules, leading to missed opportunities and fragmented time management.

**Alternatives:**
- Manual Tracking: Students rely on handwritten planners or digital calendars to track their schedules, which can become overwhelming and difficult to manage.
- Ad Hoc Coordination: Students informally communicate with group members via messaging apps or in-person discussions to schedule meetings, resulting in confusion and missed opportunities.
- Limited Visibility: Students lack visibility into each other's schedules and availability, making it challenging to find common meeting times and coordinate effectively.

**Solution:**
Develop a feature within the app that allows users to integrate their extracurricular activities and commitments into their existing schedules. This feature could include options to categorize activities, set reminders, and share schedules with group members. By providing a centralized platform for managing both academic and extracurricular schedules, the app empowers users to better organize their time and coordinate meetings with greater efficiency, ultimately enhancing their overall productivity and success.

## PAS 2

_Author: Juan Sebastian Urrea Lopez_

**Problem:**
Students often face last-minute changes in their schedules, leading to difficulties in finding available spaces for impromptu study sessions or group meetings. The current challenge lies in the lack of real-time information about space availability, making it challenging to adapt plans quickly based on the dynamic nature of students' schedules.

**Alternatives:**
- Utilize ad-hoc locations: Settle for available spaces on a first-come, first-served basis, often resulting in crowded and less-than-ideal study environments.
- Rely on word of mouth: Depend on informal communication channels to discover available spaces, leading to delays and missed opportunities for spontaneous collaboration.
- Check physical signage: Refer to physical signage on campus for information about space availability, which may not always be up-to-date or easily accessible.

**Solution:**
Implement a feature within the app that provides real-time updates on space availability, allowing users to quickly identify and reserve spaces on short notice. The app can leverage geolocation technology to guide users to the nearest available spaces, making it easier for students to adapt to schedule changes and find suitable environments for spontaneous study sessions or group meetings. This solution enhances the flexibility and responsiveness of the app in supporting dynamic scheduling needs.

**Solution:**
An app in which each person can type their free time on a schedule , providing the free spaces for them to work.

## PAS 5

_Author: Juan Esteban Cuellar Argotty_

**Problem:**
Coordinating schedules among group members to find a common available time slot and space for meetings is time-consuming and often ineffective.

**Alternatives:**
1. **Doodle Polls or Similar Tools:** Use external scheduling tools to find common availability but still face the challenge of finding an available space.
2. **Group Chats:** Discuss and agree on meeting times in group chats, which can be chaotic and inefficient.
3. **Fixed Schedule:** Set a fixed weekly meeting time and space, which may not always accommodate everyone's changing schedules.

**Solution:**
Implement an integrated scheduling tool within the university's existing systems or as a standalone app that combines space availability with group members' schedules. This tool would allow users to input their available times, and then it would automatically suggest meeting times and available spaces that fit everyone's schedule. The solution would incorporate features such as automatic calendar updates, reminders, and the ability to book spaces directly through the app, ensuring that finding and scheduling group meetings is seamless and efficient.


## PAS 6

_Author: Juan Esteban Cuellar Argotty_

**Problem:**
Difficulty in finding available spaces for peer tutoring meetings due to lack of information and coordination among students.

**Problem:**
Constantly changing schedules that alter a persons free-time availability within their friend groups, leading to complications when trying to find a space to hang out together.

**Alternatives:**
1. **“Voice-to-voice”:** Update each individual friend/friend group as soon as possible on schedule changes before they organize their time based on no longer truthful information.
2. **Shared file/calendar:** Use an online document or calendar where friends can constantly check if the schedule they knew of was still accurate, and recalculating individually available times if changes indeed happened.
3. **Immediate confirmation:** Simply let everyone set meeting times based on their schedules and later confirm whether or not they can attend.

**Solution:**
Implement a platform that allows for schedule coordination, offering each individual the possibility to simply update their own schedule and have their friends automatically have access to the updated information and how this affects their free time as a whole. 

## PAS 10

_Author: Laura Daniela Arias Flórez_

**Problem:**
Having too many schedules to organize together in order to identify available time slots where everyone is free.

**Alternatives:**
