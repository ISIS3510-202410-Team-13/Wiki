# Detailed Description

## Description of the Problem

The problem addressed by UniSchedule is the complexity and inconvenience faced by university students and others in coordinating schedules and managing meetings. Traditional methods of finding common availabilities, organizing commitments, and setting up meetings across multiple platforms can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Additionally, concerns about privacy and data security in managing personal information and schedules further complicate the process. This creates a need for a unified, secure, and efficient tool to streamline time management and enhance collaboration without compromising personal data integrity.

## Proposed Solution

Schedule is a comprehensive mobile application designed primarily for university students, aiming to simplify schedule coordination and meeting management. It integrates personal calendars, virtual conference platforms, and collaboration tools into a single, user-friendly platform, making it easier to find common availability and set up meetings. The app also prioritizes user privacy and data security with advanced privacy controls, ensuring users can manage their schedules and collaborate securely. Overall, Schedule provides a streamlined and secure solution for efficient time management and meeting coordination.

## Revenue Model

We could define the first fraction of our proposed revenue model as in-app advertising that follows a “freemium” methodology. What we mean by this is that we intend to have banner ads—not necessarily related to our operation—in some specific views. However, if any user wants to remove them completely, they can pay a one-time fee to access an ad-free version of the platform—hence the “freemium” part. We opt for banner ads specifically because they are not as invasive as others and don’t quite affect the app’s normal course of use.

The other revenue model we thought of implementing was that of data monetization. Since we collect data on students’ schedules and possible whereabouts with friends and colleagues, we could provide this information to entities s that believe could make good use of knowing when, where, and with what purpose could students be meeting in order to offer specific services or plan strategies to improve their own business or create a new one. By “taking advantage” of this need we could further monetize our idea.

## Value Proposal

Our scheduling mobile application offers a one-stop solution to the persistent problem of finding suitable time with friends and colleagues as a busy uni student with an ever-changing schedule. By allowing students to easily sync their schedules with others, it enables them to make informed choices, by notifying the user the amount of time it spends according to the schedule. This allows the user to ddministrate their time wisely, avoid procratinating, and enjoy a more satisfying break with friends while contributing to having a more efficient and productive day each day. 

Further elaborating, we offer students an effective way of finding common time slots with their peers in a way that no other application is able to.
* Save Time: You can streamline your schedule, eliminate time-wasting activities, and focus on what truly matters.
* Reduce Stress: By staying organized and on top of your commitments, you can reduce stress and anxiety associated with missed deadlines and forgotten appointments.
* Boost Productivity: The app empowers you to make the most out of your time by prioritizing tasks, avoiding distractions, and optimizing your schedule for peak performance.
* Improve Work-Life Balance: You can strike a better balance between work, personal life, and leisure activities, allowing you to enjoy more free time without sacrificing productivity

# Problems-Alternative-Solutions (PAS)

## PAS 1

_Author: Juan Sebastian Urrea Lopez_

**Problem:**
Many university students struggle with organizing their extracurricular activities and commitments alongside their academic schedules, leading to missed opportunities and fragmented time management.

**Alternatives:**
- Manual Tracking: Students rely on handwritten planners or digital calendars to track their schedules, which can become overwhelming and difficult to manage.
- Ad Hoc Coordination: Students informally communicate with group members via messaging apps or in-person discussions to schedule meetings, resulting in confusion and missed opportunities.
- Limited Visibility: Students lack visibility into each other's schedules and availability, making it challenging to find common meeting times and coordinate effectively.

**Solution:**
Develop a feature within the app that allows users to integrate their extracurricular activities and commitments into their existing schedules. This feature could include options to categorize activities, set reminders, and share schedules with group members. By providing a centralized platform for managing both academic and extracurricular schedules, the app empowers users to better organize their time and coordinate meetings with greater efficiency, ultimately enhancing their overall productivity and success.

## PAS 2

_Author: Juan Sebastian Urrea Lopez_

**Problem:**
Students often face last-minute changes in their schedules, leading to difficulties in finding available spaces for impromptu study sessions or group meetings. The current challenge lies in the lack of real-time information about space availability, making it challenging to adapt plans quickly based on the dynamic nature of students' schedules.

**Alternatives:**
- Utilize ad-hoc locations: Settle for available spaces on a first-come, first-served basis, often resulting in crowded and less-than-ideal study environments.
- Rely on word of mouth: Depend on informal communication channels to discover available spaces, leading to delays and missed opportunities for spontaneous collaboration.
- Check physical signage: Refer to physical signage on campus for information about space availability, which may not always be up-to-date or easily accessible.

**Solution:**
Implement a feature within the app that provides real-time updates on space availability, allowing users to quickly identify and reserve spaces on short notice. The app can leverage geolocation technology to guide users to the nearest available spaces, making it easier for students to adapt to schedule changes and find suitable environments for spontaneous study sessions or group meetings. This solution enhances the flexibility and responsiveness of the app in supporting dynamic scheduling needs.

## PAS 3

_Author: Juan Diego Castellanos Bonilla_

**Problem:**
A group of friends want to have lunch together in a new restaurant, nevertheless they need to find a space so they can all go and avoid the crowded hour as some of them have class later. 

**Alternatives:**
She considers making a poll in the friends chat for the best space in which most of her friends can go without losing class.

**Solution:**
To address this issue, a mobile app is proposed. The app provides a comprehensive image of the different schedules, allowing users to filter their options by blanks in the images. 
  
## PAS 4

_Author: Juan Diego Castellanos Bonilla_

**Problem:**
A student has difficulty finding spaces to work with teammates and often gets called or dropout of the group. This lead to struggles and poor academic performance as he has trouble managing his time. 

**Alternatives:**
The student tell his group his free time and skips lunch because of that or classes.   

**Solution:**
An app in which each person can type their free time on a schedule , providing the free spaces for them to work.

## PAS 5

_Author: Juan Esteban Cuellar Argotty_

**Problem:**
Coordinating schedules among group members to find a common available time slot and space for meetings is time-consuming and often ineffective.

**Alternatives:**
1. **Doodle Polls or Similar Tools:** Use external scheduling tools to find common availability but still face the challenge of finding an available space.
2. **Group Chats:** Discuss and agree on meeting times in group chats, which can be chaotic and inefficient.
3. **Fixed Schedule:** Set a fixed weekly meeting time and space, which may not always accommodate everyone's changing schedules.

**Solution:**
Implement an integrated scheduling tool within the university's existing systems or as a standalone app that combines space availability with group members' schedules. This tool would allow users to input their available times, and then it would automatically suggest meeting times and available spaces that fit everyone's schedule. The solution would incorporate features such as automatic calendar updates, reminders, and the ability to book spaces directly through the app, ensuring that finding and scheduling group meetings is seamless and efficient.


## PAS 6

_Author: Juan Esteban Cuellar Argotty_

**Problem:**
Difficulty in finding available spaces for peer tutoring meetings due to lack of information and coordination among students.

**Alternatives:**
1. **Manual Coordination:** Use social media or messaging apps to manually coordinate and share information about available spaces.
2. **Centralized Physical Bulletin Board:** Establish a physical bulletin board on campus where available spaces are posted daily.
3. **Existing University Resources:** Rely on university-provided scheduling systems or apps, which might not be fully updated or user-friendly.

**Solution:**
Develop a dedicated mobile app or web platform specifically designed for your university community that allows students and faculty to post real-time availability of rooms and spaces on campus. The platform could include features like real-time updates, the ability to reserve spaces, notifications for space availability, and integration with the university's existing scheduling systems. This solution leverages technology to streamline the process of finding and booking spaces for group meetings, making it more efficient and accessible for all students.

## PAS 7
_Author: David Santiago Ortiz Almanza_

**Problem:**
"As a teaching assistant, my main need is to conduct regular, conflict-free tutoring sessions that respect my students' busy schedules and my academic responsibilities."

**Alternatives:**
"To work around scheduling conflicts, I've been rescheduling sessions on an ad-hoc basis, which is unreliable and disruptive. At times, I've had to rely on inefficient email chains or deal with the impracticality of shared spreadsheets that quickly become outdated."

**Solution:**
Implementing an intelligent scheduling platform that integrates with university systems and personal calendars, providing real-time updates and notifications. This platform would use smart algorithms to find the best meeting times and would offer the flexibility to adjust for last-minute changes. Its value lies in reducing the time spent on scheduling and ensuring higher attendance and engagement in tutoring sessions.

## PAS 8
_Author: David Santiago Ortiz Almanza_

**Problem:**
"I need to efficiently coordinate study sessions for multiple students with varying schedules without invading their privacy or my own."

**Alternatives:**
"Currently, I try to manually match everyone's availability, which is time-consuming and often leads to conflicts. I've also tried using group chats and messaging apps, but this results in a clutter of messages and the need for constant back-and-forth communication. Some solutions have raised concerns about privacy when sharing available times."

**Solution:**
A dedicated privacy-conscious group scheduling tool specifically designed for educational settings. This tool would allow students to input their available times without revealing their entire schedule. The system could automatically suggest optimal times for group study and allow for quick polling on finalizing the best slot. This not only streamlines the process but also keeps personal schedules private.

## PAS 9

_Author: Laura Daniela Arias Flórez_

**Problem:**
Constantly changing schedules that alter a persons free-time availability within their friend groups, leading to complications when trying to find a space to hang out together.

**Alternatives:**
1. **“Voice-to-voice”:** Update each individual friend/friend group as soon as possible on schedule changes before they organize their time based on no longer truthful information.
2. **Shared file/calendar:** Use an online document or calendar where friends can constantly check if the schedule they knew of was still accurate, and recalculating individually available times if changes indeed happened.
3. **Immediate confirmation:** Simply let everyone set meeting times based on their schedules and later confirm whether or not they can attend.

**Solution:**
Implement a platform that allows for schedule coordination, offering each individual the possibility to simply update their own schedule and have their friends automatically have access to the updated information and how this affects their free time as a whole. 

## PAS 10

_Author: Laura Daniela Arias Flórez_

**Problem:**
Having too many schedules to organize together in order to identify available time slots where everyone is free.

**Alternatives:**
1. **Online simple schedule app:** Use an online schedule app that simply meets the need to link everything together or even make a new schedule that indicates free time slots instead of occupied time slots.
2. **Pen and paper:** Print or hand-draw the schedule to markup everyone’s free time.
3. **Voice/text message:** Ask every time who is available and when in order to find common grounds.

**Solution:**
Offer an app that is capable of integrating the schedules of different people and point out possible reunion times based on how many people are capable of meeting up at the given times.


## PAS 11

_Author: Lucciano Eduardo Franco Márquez_

**Problem:**
Many college students face difficulties balancing their academic commitments with their extracurricular responsibilities, resulting in inefficient time and stress management. This can lead to decreased academic performance and a feeling of overwhelm among students.

**Alternatives:**
1. Plan flexible schedules with friends to meet responsibilities
2. Structure a plan that covers personal activities without leaving aside curricular activities

**Solution:**
An app could allow students to create to-do lists and set short- and long-term goals, helping them prioritize their activities and stay focused on their goals.


## PAS 12

_Author: Lucciano Eduardo Franco Márquez_

**Problem:**
Students have problems keeping up with personal and family activities due to university commitments or simple physical fatigue.

**Alternatives:**
1. Develop a weekly to-do to know and have the time measured so that you can rest or do pending items and fulfill your aspirations.
2. Have an app that examines your tasks and proposes a rest or concentration schedule to complete your week.

**Solution:**
An app that, depending on their homework, has different times to rest and give students the opportunity to do everything they set out to do
