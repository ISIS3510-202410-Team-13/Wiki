## Procedure

The brainstorming session we conducted commenced by identifying three pressing issues we were keen to address: the Gastronomic Offer Problem, the Schedule Coordination Problem, and the Search for Tutoring Problem. For each issue, we freely generated a variety of solutions, valuing each idea without judgment. These were noted on post-its and arranged under the corresponding problem title on a board, all within a 10-minute brainstorming window.

Subsequently, we examined all the suggested ideas. While we initially categorized these into Rational Choice, Most Likely to Delight, Darling, and Long Shot.

For the Gastronomic Offer Problem, significant solutions included enabling real-time visibility of restaurant occupancy, keeping menus and prices current, providing tailored recommendations, incorporating businesses without physical locations, facilitating advanced orders, and identifying discounts.

In tackling the Schedule Coordination Problem, solutions proposed were identifying available meeting spaces, enhancing privacy settings for events, allowing extensive event customization, integrating with other platforms, implementing automatic tracking, utilizing NFC technology for adding friends, and creating an analytics dashboard.

Regarding the Search for Tutoring Problem, the solutions centered around optimizing tutoring services, such as monetizing free time for tutors, providing access to specialized subject notes, offering extra compensation for tutoring during unconventional hours, and sending out notifications for tutoring sessions.
