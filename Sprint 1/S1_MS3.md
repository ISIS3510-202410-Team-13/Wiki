# Brainstorming Process

To kickstart our brainstorming session, we delved deeper in on our user base: university students at Los Andes University. Through interviews, we pinpointed recurring challenges, particularly the Schedule Coordination Problem. We crafted a User Persona and Empathy Maps, offering a comprehensive view of our target user's daily life, struggles, and aspirations.

Armed with these insights, we employed a divergence-convergence pattern in brainstorming. The divergence phase encouraged a wide range of ideas, fostering creativity without judgment. Our focus remained on solutions catering to the specific needs of Los Andes University students.

# Decision Process

Moving into the convergence phase, we carefully assessed and refined our ideas. We catategorized them based on feasibility, desirability, and alignment with user needs identified not only from our Empathy Maps, but also from the User Personas derived from them. These personas we constructed gifted us a better understanding of the features that would benefit our different types of users the most. Like so, our solutions were narrowed down to streamline schedule management, enhance organization, and reduce the stress of juggling commitments. The most important features that came from this process were:
- Student Profile and Login
- Create your schedule manually or import it from other apps/systems (including Banner).
- Personalize your classes and events with privacy, colors, titles, icons, sounds, etc.
- See your daily schedule in a glance.
- Add friends and share with them my schedule (with QR code or NFC).
- Easily propose an event with several friends.
- Be able to comment on a proposal, suggest a new time or activity.
- Automatically suggest a classroom or available space on campus for the event.
- Associate events with Courses
- Add information on grades and weekly to-do lists for each course.
