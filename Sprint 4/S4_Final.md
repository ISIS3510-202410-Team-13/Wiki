# Micro-Optimization Strategies

## GPU Rendering Analysis

https://github.com/ISIS3510-202410-Team-13/Wiki/assets/78111224/f4e8861f-37ad-4c89-ba34-8c011212303f

### Login Process

During the initial login process, a notable increase in frame time was observed, particularly in the UI thread. This surge is attributed to the heavy computations and data loading necessary for authentication and setting up the user environment. The UI thread experienced significant activity as it processed the login credentials and initialized the user's session. Despite the initial spike, the system demonstrated efficient handling of these tasks, stabilizing quickly. This indicates that while the login process is resource-intensive, the current implementation manages it effectively without prolonged performance degradation.

### Event Creation and Recommendation Tool

When creating events, another significant rise in frame time was recorded. The increased activity in the UI thread during this period is aligned with the complexity of rendering new event forms and updating the calendar view. The recommendation tool for places also caused noticeable spikes in frame time. This tool performs intensive computations to filter and suggest suitable locations, resulting in temporary performance hits. These spikes, although momentary, highlight the computational demands of the recommendation algorithm and suggest that optimization in this area could lead to a smoother user experience.

### Filtering Friends and Groups

The actions of filtering friends and groups showed increased frame times and occasional jank, indicating that these operations are adding substantial load to the system. The analysis revealed that this was further exacerbated by oversized images in the home and calendar tabs, which significantly added to the rendering load. These oversized images caused additional strain on the UI thread, leading to frame drops and an overall decrease in responsiveness. Optimizing image sizes and implementing better image loading strategies could mitigate these issues and improve the performance during filtering operations.


The performance analysis identified key areas where the application can be optimized to enhance user experience. The initial login process, while resource-intensive, stabilizes quickly and efficiently. However, event creation and the recommendation tool for places present opportunities for optimization due to their high computational demands. Additionally, filtering friends and groups, combined with the presence of oversized images, further impacts performance. Addressing these issues through optimization strategies will result in a more responsive and user-friendly application. Implementing these changes will not only improve performance but also increase user satisfaction and engagement.

### Oversized Images Analysis

<img src="https://github.com/ISIS3510-202410-Team-13/Wiki/assets/78111224/c3184f57-3d05-4400-89e0-54afd8fe23ae" width="325">
<img src="https://github.com/ISIS3510-202410-Team-13/Wiki/assets/78111224/e935beb8-6c52-48e4-adfe-4a5597aab4f2" width="325">

We observe issues with GPU rendering upon entering the calendar and home section. Specifically, the most significant problem occurs when attempting to render the main image of the view. Upon entering the detail and using the profiling tool that highlights and flips images occupying substantial space, we can see that this main image is indeed causing the issue. This could be resolved by reducing the resolution of the image, as its size ensures that the reduction in quality will not be noticeable. This adjustment would decrease the load on the GPU and enhance the overall performance.

## Overdrawing Analysis

https://github.com/ISIS3510-202410-Team-13/Wiki/assets/69651671/e7fffceb-481b-456f-91c1-ebc92a986601


In the "UniSchedule" app, it was observed that there is no overdraw as the Android debug tool paints everything blue, except during interactions external to the application such as when the keyboard is deployed for typing.

Regarding repainting, generally, the app does not exhibit excessive repainting. However, in sections where text fields are written into or when the date and time of an event are changed, some repainting of those sections occurs. The most significant problem was detected during the creation of events when adding participants and labels, as it caused repainting of a large portion of the event creation form.

This minimal overdraw indicates efficient UI layering and resource usage, a positive aspect for the "UniSchedule" app. On the other hand, the repainting observed in specific interactions could impact user experience and performance. The excessive repainting during event creation suggests potential inefficiencies in how state changes are managed within the form. Optimizing these interactions could improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.

## Memory Management Analysis


https://github.com/ISIS3510-202410-Team-13/Wiki/assets/78111224/a277cdf8-7f85-4270-bda2-e681afb7c497


### Login Process

During the initial login process, a significant number of instances were created, particularly for classes related to UI rendering and data handling. Notably, the `Frame` and `_Node` classes exhibited high instance counts and memory usage, which is expected due to the intensive operations required for setting up the user interface and loading user data. Despite the temporary increase in memory usage, these instances were effectively managed, with a substantial portion allocated in the new space, indicating efficient garbage collection. However, there were isolated instances of memory leaks associated with the `Frame` class that need addressing to prevent long-term performance degradation.

### Event Creation and Recommendation Tool

Creating events and using the recommendation tool for places also resulted in notable memory usage spikes. Classes such as `_$GroupModel` and `_$FriendModel`, which are involved in managing event data and recommendations, showed increased instances and memory allocation. The memory data indicates that these objects are predominantly allocated in the new space, with minimal promotion to the old space, suggesting efficient short-term memory usage. Nevertheless, the high instance counts and sizes highlight potential areas for optimization. For example, refactoring these classes to reduce object creation overhead or employing object pooling techniques could significantly enhance memory efficiency.

### Filtering Friends and Groups

Filtering friends and groups revealed increased memory allocation, particularly for classes handling UI components and data models. The `EqualUnmodifiableListView` class showed a significant number of instances, reflecting the demand for managing filtered lists. Additionally, memory fragmentation issues were detected, leading to increased garbage collection overhead. To mitigate this, implementing more efficient data structures and algorithms for filtering operations is recommended. This will not only reduce memory usage but also enhance the application's responsiveness during intensive filtering tasks.

Overall, the memory management analysis identified key areas for optimization to improve the application's performance and stability. While the initial login process and short-term memory usage during event creation and recommendations are managed efficiently, there are opportunities to optimize object creation and reuse. Addressing memory leaks, optimizing data structures for filtering operations, and reducing memory fragmentation will further enhance the application's responsiveness and user experience. Implementing these optimizations will lead to better memory management, reduced latency, and increased user satisfaction.

# Implemented Eventual Connectivity Strategies

> Check out the strategies we implemented in previous sprints [here](https://github.com/ISIS3510-202410-Team-13/Wiki/wiki/S3_Final#eventual-connectivity-scenarios)!

Our eventual connectivity strategies in Sprint 4 include several key components to ensure a seamless user experience, even in offline scenarios:

* **Notification Handling**: When the device is offline, a special connectivity notification is displayed at the top of the notification list, informing the user about the lack of internet connection and its potential impact on missing new notifications. This is implemented through the `ConnectivityNotification` class and integrated within the notifications view.

* **Chat Handling**: When the device is offline, a special connectivity notification is displayed at the top of the Chat list, informing the user about the lack of internet connection and its potential impact on missing new messages. Unsent messages are saved in a queue and will be sent as soon as internet connection becomes available again.

* **Group Creation**: In the group creation functionality, we now preemptively check the internet connection before allowing the user to proceed with creating a group. If there is no internet connection, the option to create a group is disabled. Additionally, the button undergoes a visual transformation‚Äîchanging its color and text‚Äîto clearly indicate to the user that group creation requires an internet connection. This preemptive check is crucial as creating a group involves multiple database operations that could impact several users, thereby necessitating reliable connectivity to ensure data consistency and prevent potential conflicts.

* **Local Storage for Notifications**: Notifications are stored in local storage using Hive. This ensures that users can access their notifications even when offline. New notifications received while offline are saved locally and displayed the next time the app is opened.

* **Local Storage for Chats**: Chats information is stored in local storage using Hive. This ensures that users can access their messages even when offline. New messages received while offline are saved locally and displayed the next time the app is opened.

# Implemented Local Storage Strategies

> Check out the strategies we implemented in previous sprints [here](https://github.com/ISIS3510-202410-Team-13/Wiki/wiki/S3_Final#implemented-local-storage-strategies)!

In our application, implementing local storage strategies is crucial for enhancing offline functionality and providing a seamless user experience, even in the absence of an internet connection. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of our local storage implementation for Sprint 4:

* **Notifications**: Notifications are stored locally using Hive. This allows users to access their notifications offline. When the device regains connectivity, any new notifications are synchronized and displayed.

* **Chat**: Chats are stored locally using Hive. The chat messages, participants information and last typed text are included in the Hive Box. This allows users to read their chats offline. Users can send new messages while offline, which are promptly notified as soon as connectivity comes back and all the new data is updated in the database.

* **Efficiency and Performance**: Accessing data from local storage is significantly faster than fetching it over the internet. This leads to quicker load times and a smoother user experience.

* **Reliability and Data Integrity**: Users can rely on the app to function effectively even when offline. By syncing data whenever an internet connection is available, we ensure that the user's information remains up-to-date.

#### **Advantages of This Approach:**
1. **Enhanced Performance**: Accessing data from local storage is significantly faster than fetching it over the internet, leading to quicker load times and a smoother user experience.
2. **Reliability**: Users can rely on the app to function effectively even when they are offline, which is crucial for mobile applications where constant connectivity cannot be guaranteed.
3. **Data Integrity**: By syncing data whenever the internet connection is available, we ensure that the user's information remains up-to-date across all devices.

# Implemented Multithreading Strategies

> Check out the strategies we implemented in previous sprints [here](https://github.com/ISIS3510-202410-Team-13/Wiki/wiki/S3_Final#implemented-multi-threading-strategy)!

In this Sprint, we further enhanced our multi-threading approach by introducing a dedicated "Background Thread" for various services within our application. This thread continuously monitors external events, ensuring immediate interaction within the app without disrupting ongoing user activities. A key implementation includes a background thread that remains vigilant for external notifications, such as the launch of new features. When such events occur, the application is promptly notified, allowing for seamless communication to the user. Likewise, our Chat features use Streams to update themselves based on changes detected in Firestore documents automatically. This strategy ensures that our application can handle these events efficiently without blocking the main thread, thus maintaining a smooth and responsive user experience.

# Implemented Caching Strategies

> Check out the strategies we implemented in previous sprints [here](https://github.com/ISIS3510-202410-Team-13/Wiki/wiki/S3_Final#implemented-caching-strategies)!

The caching strategy we implemented in Sprint 4 involves storing images and text in notifications and chats to enhance application performance and support eventual connectivity. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown:

* **Image Caching**: We integrated the `cached_network_image` package to cache images used in notifications and chats. This ensures that images are loaded quickly and are available even when the device is offline.
  
* **Performance Improvement**: Caching images reduces the load on the network and accelerates image rendering, providing a better user experience.

* **Offline Support**: Cached images are available when the device is offline, ensuring that the notifications and chat views remain functional and visually complete.

* **Cache typed text in Chat**: To enhance UX, we cache the text typed by the user on each different chat it has. This way, even if the app closes unexpectedly or the user loses connectivity, it can stay calmed knowing that the app will remember its message the next time it opens the app.
